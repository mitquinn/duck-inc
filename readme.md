**Day 1**

Estimated Completion Time: 10-20 minutes.

Welcome new _Duck Inc_.

You have accepted this position at the amazing Duck Inc. We have this amazing new cloning technology that will transform your code into real ducks. Surprisingly it runs on PHP!

So for your first project we need you to build a Mallard.

Luckily ducks are surprisingly easy to create because the cloning machine is so advanced. 

All you need to do is:
 - Create a Mallard class (we handled the creation of the file for you.)
 - The Mallard class will need to be able to fly, quack, swim. When you add these methods the cloning machine will give the duck these abilities.
 - Each method should just return its name in the form of a string. (Example: quack()->"quack" ).
 - The sales team has already let us know that more species of duck are going to be needed in the future. So keep that in mind.
 - The _Duck Inc_ QA team handled the phpunit test for you. These will validate the ducks you are creating. If you want to test your work feel free to run phpunit root directory"

We included a little markup to get you started today. We need you to complete work by Wednesday. Your pull request should be submitted in the format of "Your Name - Day 1"

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to Mitch or Kelvin.

Good Luck on your first day!
